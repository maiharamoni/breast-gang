            <p id="style-p">Since 2023, we have supported causes that mobilize society to promote women's empowerment.

                We believe in reliable breast health education and facilitating access to early detection tests and 
                timely treatment to save lives.
                
                Breast cancer is the most common in the world, and most of them are noticed by the patient herself when 
                noticing the first signs and seeking medical support. But depending on where she is and which health 
                system she turns to - public or private - her journey can be very different, as well as her chance of cure.
                The delay in detection and the long wait to start treatment are the main challenges faced by thousands 
                of women around the world, and to reduce deaths related to the disease, we need to talk about breast 
                cancer all year round, not just one month of the year.
                
                The breast warrior embraces the cause of fighting against breast cancer.</p>
