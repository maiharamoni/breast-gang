## Design

My choice of colors was to bring impact as soon as the user accesses the site and to bring an image of recognition for future campaigns.

### Unfixed Bugs

I believe that due to lack of skill and understanding I was unable to resolve the bugs found even though I made the requested changes.

In the future I intend to focus more on the responsiveness of the site and its functionalities.
